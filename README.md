# The problem

Egypt loses about 12,000 lives due to road traffic crashes every year. It has a road traffic fatality rate of 42 deaths per 100,000 population. Majority (48%) of those killed are passengers of four-wheelers though pedestrians also constitute a significant proportion (20%) of these fatalities. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drowsy driving was responsible for 72,000 crashes, 44,000 injuries, and 800 deaths in 2013 alone.

# Introduction
Most accidents are due to drivers becoming tired or sleepy. Our project aims to address this issue by using technology to monitor driver alertness and provide timely warnings. Using facial recognition and other sensors, we can detect signs of drowsiness and take action to prevent accidents.

# Methods

|  ![Test Image]([[https://github.com/mohitwildbeast/Driver-Drowsiness-Detector/blob/master/images/test.jpeg]()](https://github.com/yousefreda1014/Drowsy-Driver-Detector/blob/main/1619561047134.jpeg?raw=true)|
Mount the camera and connect it to Arduino to form a basic recognition setup.
Configure the camera to detect eye closures and send signals to a buzzer to wake up the driver.
Implement facial recognition to analyze the driver’s eye movements.

# Testing
Evaluate the system under various conditions to ensure reliability.
Test the ability to alert the driver in case of detected drowsiness.
Conduct field tests to verify the system’s efficiency.

# Results
The system successfully detected driver drowsiness and sent wake-up alerts.
Implemented alert mechanisms significantly improved driver alertness.
Verified the system’s ability to contact emergency services in case of severe conditions.

# Recommendations
Use a modern camera to improve detection accuracy.
Ensure the system minimizes noise for better signal clarity.
Integrate with the car’s existing safety systems for enhanced performance.
