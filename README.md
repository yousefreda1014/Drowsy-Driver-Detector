# Drowsy-Driver-Detector
A project to address a significant concern: the incidence of accidents resulting from drowsy driving on highways.This program detects drowsiness in individuals by monitoring the duration their eyes remain closed. When the eyes are shut beyond a specified threshold, an alarm sound is triggered to alert the user.This project involves the development of an embedded system for automobiles that utilizes facial recognition techniques to monitor eye movements, detecting when a driver may be entering a sleep cycle. In such an event, the system triggers an alarm to awaken the driver, enhancing road safety.
